# Heart-disease-prediction

The **Heart Disease Prediction** project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical data. The project begins with extensive **data analysis**, including **univariate and bivariate analysis**, to identify patterns and relationships among features. These analyses provide insights into the dataset's structure and its potential impact on prediction accuracy. The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature selection to optimize the dataset for machine learning models.

Multiple machine learning algorithms, including **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Logistic Regression**, **Neural Networks**, **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Gradient Boosting**, were implemented and evaluated. Each model's performance was compared using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The best-performing model was saved and used for final predictions. This comprehensive approach ensures the robustness and reliability of the prediction system, making it an essential tool for early heart disease detection and proactive healthcare.
